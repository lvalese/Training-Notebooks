<sub>*Notebooks used to training Python programming*

As a dedicated financial professional working for almost 15 years at a multinational company in Brazil (Sao Paulo), with a high interest in new technologies and dealing with so many data in my daily routines, it was natural that the topic **"Data Science"** at any time would suddenly appear in front of me.
Follower of the "Lifelong Learner Philosophy", I was always interested in developing both my hard (technical) and soft (behavioral) skills, but I've never thought I would be interested in any programming language. But here I am! Starting this repository.

The initial idea for this Training-Notebooks repository, is to create one notebook for each of the main basic functions of Python, as below:
 
* **Mathematical functions:** https://bit.ly/3dpc0Gg
* **Types:** https://bit.ly/2xhPPBf
* **Expressions and Variables**
* **Strings**
* **Lists and Tuples**
* **Dictionary**
* **Sets**
* **Conditions and Branching**
* **Loops**
* **Functions**
* **Objects and Classes**

This notebooks will have two main purposes:

* __I will learn by doing__
* __I will learn by teaching__

Saying that, you will probably see in my noteebooks _inspired_ or _based_ exercises absorbed in the last months of hard study!
I will also try to insert as many #comments as possible in my Notebooks to help you as a beginner student to understand the functioning of Python.

Suggestions, critics or doubt could be sent to my personal e-mail: _lvalese@gmail.com_

Good studies to all of us!
Rgds,
L.V.
